<h3>About Me:</h3>
I am currently working on rethinking hvac design using real-time indoor air quality monitoring. <br/>
<br/>The goal is to improve occupant health and comfort and to reduce energy bills.

<h3>My Philosophy:</h3>
"Simplicity enables the application of intelligence."<br/>
<br/>"Everything around you that you call ‘life’ was made up by people who were no smarter than you.<br/>
<br/>You can change it, build your own things that other people can use."
